Birdy?? Birdy bird got stuck in pile of pipes
OH NO!

```Now he flaps
And he claps
God knows his nest
Ais childern need rest

O great traveler
Birdy got a antena
Please consider giving a hand
As, for your click he craves

Skipping the pipes of urbanization
His only mission
The chicks need his attention
Like you, i and him
Not so different

Oh the pain
Why was it not a plane
A linear locus, where y = 0
Or can you make it one and become a hero.
Be in music, politics, school what you need is a beer.
Or you know, you can just click ```[here](https://phuyalgaurav.github.io/birdy)
